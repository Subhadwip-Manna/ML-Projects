1. Different Machine Learning projects on different Datasets.

2. Project on TMDB dataset : In this project, we utilized the TMDB movie dataset to predict movie Ratings , Genre and Revenue. Through our comprehensive machine learning analysis, we successfully identified the key factors that significantly influence the ratings of movies. By exploring various features such as cast, budget, genre, and release date, we gained valuable insights into the determinants of a movie's success. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the factors that contribute to high-rated films, enabling better decision-making in the film industry.
